### Odin Project Title: 
Landing Page - [click here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

### Project Description: 
As part of *The Odin Project's* curriculum, I created the fictional James' Hot Rod Garage to practice my front-end skills. Specifically, I wanted to further my new understanding of flexbox and alignment. I decided to create my own fictional company so that I could practice making design decisions. 

### Future Improvements:
 Since this is my first landing page, there is many room for improvements. 
 * Implement cleaner display for initial viewport.
 * Complete quote section alignment without the use of paddign 
 * Explore Figma, and incorporate the software it my creation of future projects alongside better design practices. 
 * Fix poor coding practices. No more messy HTML and CSS.
 * Terminate the gradient background
 * Make adaptive to phone screen layout 
 * Fix absolute positioning in "Call to Action" section
